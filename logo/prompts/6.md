**Design Brief:**
- **Inspiration:** The interconnected dots or circles in a tapestry pattern represent insights and growth, which can be visualized as some dots or circles being brighter or larger than others.
- **Color Scheme:** Teal and blue, which convey trust, calm, and intelligenceâ€”perfect for storytelling and personalization themes.
- **Subtle Storytelling:** The tapestry pattern itself can suggest a story woven together, with each dot or circle adding to the overall narrative, symbolizing the personal stories or insights that TrueTap might offer its users.
