Create a minimalist logo for a digital platform named "TrueTap". The design should feature a tapestry-inspired pattern made of interconnected dots and circles, varying in brightness and size to symbolize insights and growth. Use a color palette primarily consisting of teal and blue. The logo should subtly convey themes of storytelling and personalization. Aim for a clean, modern look that is both distinctive and professional, suitable for a tech-savvy audience.
