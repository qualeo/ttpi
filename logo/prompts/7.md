Design a minimalist logo for "TrueTap," inspired by tapestry patterns. The logo should feature interconnected dots or circles of varying sizes and brightness, symbolizing insights and growth. Employ a color palette of teal and blue, and subtly incorporate themes of storytelling and personalization. The design should also suggest the concept of a timeline or progression subtly.
